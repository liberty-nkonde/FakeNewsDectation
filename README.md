# TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency and is a statistic that aims to better define how important a word is for a document, while also taking into account the relation to other documents from the same corpus.

This is performed by looking at how many times a word appears into a document while also paying attention to how many times the same word appears in other documents in the corpus.


TF-IDF is a score which is applied to every word in every document in our dataset. And for every word, the TF-IDF value increases with every appearance of the word in a document, but is gradually decreased with every appearance in other documents

What is a TfidfVectorizer?
TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.

The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features

# =============================================

# Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector.

# Summary

learned to detect fake news with Python. We took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. We ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.82% in magnitude
